                <p class="habit-text">“Change might not be fast and it isn't always easy. But with time and effort,
                    almost any habit can be reshaped.” – Charles Duhigg</p>

                    <h5 class="habit-card-title">Movement</h5>
                    <p class="habit-card-text">Movement helps our bodies develop properly when we're young, and can
                        reduce the risk of illness as we age. It can help maintain muscle elasticity and power, and
                        improve circulation, digestion, metabolism, and immunity. Movement can also help with joint
                        health by nourishing synovial fluid, which reduces friction on cartilage and protects bones.</p>

                    <p class="habit-card-text">Time management skills help you reduce stress and prioritise your time.
                        Effective time management clarifies your goals and prioritises your most important tasks. As a
                        result, you have more time to achieve bigger and better results. When you manage your time, you
                        can plan your day and increase your performance.</p>

                    <p class="habit-card-text">Practice helps people reach their highest potential. It is a life skill
                        that allows individuals to develop expertise in specific tasks. Practice doesn't make perfect,
                        but it does enhance confidence and can be a powerful tool that helps you reach your goals.</p>

                    <p class="habit-card-text">Weight loss to a healthy weight for a person's height can promote health
                        benefits. These include lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure, less
                        stress on bones and joints, and less work for the heart. It is vital to maintain weight loss to
                        obtain health benefits over a lifetime.</p>

                <h2 class="run-title">Run an Extra Mile Easily</h2>
                <p class="run-text">Running is a weight-bearing exercise that can help build strong   bones, increase bone density, and strengthen muscles. It can also improve cardiovascular fitness, burn calories, and help maintain a healthy weight. Running can also help with posture and balance, which can reduce the risk of falls and injuries. Running can help improve your mood, reduce anxiety and depression, and increase your ability to focus and multitask. It can also help blunt the brain's response to stress and may even help reduce the risk of dementia and other neurological conditions. Running can also trigger the release of endorphins, which can help relieve pain and stress. Running can also help with sleep, knee and back health, and your immune system.
